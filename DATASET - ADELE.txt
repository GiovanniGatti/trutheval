question: What are the main stages of the water cycle?

ground_truth: The water cycle consists of several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff. Evaporation occurs when water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into vapor due to heat from the sun. The vapor rises and cools, forming clouds in the condensation stage. Precipitation happens when water droplets in clouds become heavy and fall as rain, snow, or hail. Some of the water infiltrates the ground, replenishing groundwater, while the rest flows back to water bodies as runoff, completing the cycle.

a0: The water cycle includes several key stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff. During evaporation, water from oceans, lakes, and rivers is heated by the sun and turns into vapor. This vapor rises into the atmosphere and cools, forming clouds in the condensation stage. Precipitation occurs when the water droplets in clouds become heavy and fall to the ground as rain, snow, or hail. Some of this water seeps into the ground, replenishing groundwater through infiltration, while the rest flows back into rivers, lakes, and oceans as runoff, completing the cycle.

a1: The water cycle includes several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff. During evaporation, water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into vapor due to heat from the sun. This vapor rises and forms clouds in the condensation stage without significant cooling. Precipitation occurs when the water droplets in clouds become heavy and fall to the ground as rain or snow. Some of this water seeps into the ground through infiltration, replenishing groundwater, while the rest flows back into rivers and oceans as runoff. The cycle is influenced by wind patterns, which distribute moisture around the planet, helping to complete the cycle.

a2: The water cycle includes several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. During evaporation, water from oceans and rivers turns into vapor due to heat from the sun. This vapor rises and forms clouds in the condensation stage. Precipitation happens when clouds release water as rain or snow, but most of it evaporates before reaching the ground. Runoff occurs when water flows directly into the ocean, skipping rivers and lakes. Infiltration is not a significant part of the water cycle, as most water stays on the surface. The cycle is mainly controlled by the Earth's rotation, which moves water around the planet.

a3: The water cycle includes several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. It begins when water from oceans and rivers is absorbed by plants and released into the air, forming clouds in the condensation stage. Precipitation happens when clouds release water as rain, snow, or hail, but much of it is absorbed directly into the soil. Runoff occurs when water flows into underground rivers, bypassing lakes and streams. Evaporation plays a minor role in the cycle, as most water movement is driven by plant activity and wind patterns.

a4: The water cycle consists of a few stages, starting with water being absorbed by plants and turned directly into clouds. These clouds then release water as snow or hail, which melts and flows into underground rivers. The water cycle ends when the water is stored permanently in the soil, where it stays until plants use it again. Evaporation and sunlight are not necessary for the water cycle to occur.
