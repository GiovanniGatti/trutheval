        "question": "What are the main causes of climate change?",
        "ground_truth": "Climate change is primarily caused by human activities that increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy and transportation is the largest contributor. Deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices also release significant amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming."

        "question": "How does photosynthesis work in plants?",
        "ground_truth": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll absorbs sunlight. The process uses carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil, producing glucose and oxygen as byproducts. The overall chemical equation is: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂."

        "question": "What are the main stages of the water cycle?",
        "ground_truth": "The water cycle consists of several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff. Evaporation occurs when water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into vapor due to heat from the sun. The vapor rises and cools, forming clouds in the condensation stage. Precipitation happens when water droplets in clouds become heavy and fall as rain, snow, or hail. Some of the water infiltrates the ground, replenishing groundwater, while the rest flows back to water bodies as runoff, completing the cycle."

        "question": "What are the three states of matter?",
        "ground_truth": "The three fundamental states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. In solids, particles are tightly packed in a fixed arrangement, giving them a definite shape and volume. Liquids have particles that are close together but can move past one another, allowing them to have a definite volume but take the shape of their container. Gases have particles that are far apart and move freely, so they have neither a definite shape nor a definite volume."

        "question": "In what ways can we stop a fire?",
        "ground_truth": "To start and propagate, a fire needs three elements: heat, fuel, and oxygen. Eliminating any of these three elements will effectively stop a fire. One can remove the fuel by cleaning the area with firebreaks (spaces cleared from vegetation), or by starting a controlled fire. Another way to stop a fire is by removing heat, typically done by pouring water and particularly effective for solid combustibles like wood or paper. The last way to stop a fire is by removing oxygen. This approach typically involves throwing at the fire materials like sand, dirt, or fire blankets."

        "question": "What types of volcanoes are found on Venus, and how do they differ from those on Earth?",
        "ground_truth": "On Venus, there are shield volcanoes, pancake dome volcanoes, and scalloped margin domes. Shield volcanoes on Venus can cover hundreds of kilometers in area and have an average height of 1.5 kilometers. They cause the Venusian lithosphere to flex downward and can produce flexural moats and ring fractures. Pancake dome volcanoes on Venus are up to 15 kilometers in diameter and less than 1 kilometer in height. They are associated with coronae and tesserae and are formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under Venus's high atmospheric pressure. Scalloped margin domes, also known as 'tick-like' structures, have numerous legs and have undergone mass wasting events such as landslides on their margins. These types of volcanoes are not present on Earth. On Earth, volcanoes are mainly of two types: shield volcanoes and composite or stratovolcanoes. Shield volcanoes, like those in Hawaii, eject relatively fluid magma from hot spots, while composite volcanoes, like Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo, are associated with tectonic plates and erupt gummier lava."

        "question": "What were the temperatures and snowfall amounts during the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023, and how many people and livestock were affected?",
        "ground_truth": "During the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023, temperatures reached as low as −33 °C (−27 °F) and snowfall was as high as 30 centimetres (12 in) in more mountainous regions. This extreme weather event resulted in the deaths of at least 160 people and the loss of nearly 80,000 livestock. The cold snap became the deadliest weather event of 2023 until Cyclone Freddy. In addition to the human and animal casualties, over 50 houses were damaged across the country. The impact of the cold snap was particularly severe due to the ongoing famine in Afghanistan and limited foreign aid caused by the country's pariah state status. Relief efforts, including heating and relief funds, were provided by humanitarian organizations, although foreign relief efforts were complicated by restrictions on women providing aid. Military helicopters were used to provide relief to citizens cut off by snow, but they were unable to access the mountainous regions of Afghanistan."
