The implementation of platooning is made possible through advanced technologies such as adaptive cruise control and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, which facilitate the coordination of speed and movement among vehicles."

These include tax cuts and money creation by the government, which led to budget deficits and a decline in government revenue. The government's decision to shift to organic or biological farming also played a role.

The country's high external debt, with a significant increase in foreign debt in recent years, also contributed to the crisis.

        "question": "What types of volcanoes are found on Venus, and how do they differ from those on Earth?",
        "ground_truth": "On Venus, there are shield volcanoes, pancake dome volcanoes, and scalloped margin domes. Shield volcanoes on Venus can cover hundreds of kilometers in area and have an average height of 1.5 kilometers. They cause the Venusian lithosphere to flex downward and can produce flexural moats and ring fractures. Pancake dome volcanoes on Venus are up to 15 kilometers in diameter and less than 1 kilometer in height. They are associated with coronae and tesserae and are formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under Venus's high atmospheric pressure. Scalloped margin domes, also known as 'tick-like' structures, have numerous legs and have undergone mass wasting events such as landslides on their margins. These types of volcanoes are not present on Earth. On Earth, volcanoes are mainly of two types: shield volcanoes and composite or stratovolcanoes. Shield volcanoes, like those in Hawaii, eject relatively fluid magma from hot spots, while composite volcanoes, like Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo, are associated with tectonic plates and erupt gummier lava.",

        "ground_truth": "The Roanoke and Tar River Railroad was fully merged into the Seaboard Air Line Railway network in 1911. After the merger, the line operated as the Seaboard Air Line's Lewiston Subdivision. In 1967, the Seaboard Air Line merged with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. The Lewiston Subdivision connected with an ex-ACL line in Kelford. In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the Chessie System to create the CSX Corporation. The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation.

        "ground_truth": "Theranostics, also known as theragnostics, is an emerging field in precision medicine that combines diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to provide the potential for personalized treatment and real-time monitoring of the effectiveness of treatments. It utilizes improvements in imaging techniques and targeted therapies to achieve this goal. Medical imaging plays a crucial role in theranostics by enabling non-invasive visualization of disease processes, identification of specific molecular targets, and monitoring treatment response. By coupling medical imaging with the development of novel radiotracers and contrast agents, theranostics offers opportunities for precise diagnosis and targeted therapy. Diagnostic-therapeutic approaches are used in theranostics, where the diagnostic method is developed simultaneously with the therapeutic intervention or serves as the method itself.

        "ground_truth": "The human climate niche refers to the range of climate conditions that have supported human life and activities, such as agriculture, over the past thousand years. It is estimated by calculating the human population density in relation to the mean annual temperature. The distribution of the human population based on mean annual temperature shows two modes, one at 15 °C and another at approximately 20 to 25 °C. These temperature ranges are also suitable for growing crops and raising livestock, which are essential for sustaining the human population. However, with the increase in global temperatures, it is projected that the human population will experience climate conditions that fall outside of the human climate niche. Projections indicate that by 2030 and 2090, 2.0 and 3.7 billion people, respectively, will be living in areas that are beyond the human climate niche. This highlights the potential challenges and impacts of climate change on human populations.",
