# TruthEval

`trutheval` is a modular framework for generating datasets with graded factual perturbations. These datasets are
designed to test and validate the effectiveness of factuality evaluation pipelines.

It provides:

* 📚 Tools to generate Q&A datasets with controlled factual perturbations (A0–A4 levels)
* 🧪 Evaluation scripts and interfaces for comparing human vs. model-based assessments (see [UI](#ui))
* 📊 Data and metrics to support validation of factual scoring algorithms (see [datasets](#datasets))

Core components:

* [truthbench](./truthbench/README.md): Generates factual QA datasets with controlled perturbations. It's intended to
  support the development, tuning, and validation of factuality metrics and hallucination detection systems
* [truthscore](./truthscore/README.md): A fast, open-weight alternative to RAGAS using NLI models for factual
  scoring—cheaper, faster, and comparably effective. It's intended to evaluate LLMs directly.

Our framework includes extensive experimental validation, where we generate datasets with graduated factual
perturbations and benchmark diverse evaluation techniques — including open-weight LLMs and specialized
pipelines — demonstrating strong correlation between perturbation severity and factuality scores.

This work is described in detail in an accepted paper at the EvalLLM 2025 workshop (CORIA-TALN).

# Datasets

We are also open-sourcing the [datasets](./datasets) we used to access the quality of our pipeline. In short, we asked
annotators to compare the perceived quality of answers between experts and pipeline generated. The annotators needed to
decide which option aligned best to a specific set of guidelines (which can be found at our paper; see Appendix C). The
annotators have the alternative of accepting both options (if they had perceived similar quality) or rejecting them
both (if they both didn't comply with guidelines).

# UI

We provide a user-friendly webapp to facilitate comparing A0-A4 responses generated by different sources. The UI
provides a side-by-side visualization with diff capabilities. This tool was used by annotators to produce evaluate the
quality of our pipeline.

One must provide an input dataset with the following schema:

```jsonc
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "question": "What are the main causes of climate change?",
      "ground_truth": "Climate change is primarily ...",
      "answers": {
        "A0": {
          "ai": "Human activities are the main drivers of climate change...",
          "human": "The primary driver of climate change is human activity..."
        },
        "A1": {
          "ai": "...",
          "human": "..."
        },
        "A2": {
          "ai": "...",
          "human": "..."
        },
        "A3": {
          "ai": "...",
          "human": "..."
        },
        "A4": {
          "ai": "...",
          "human": "..."
        }
      }
    },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

After evaluation, the results are exported with the following format (dictionary keys are the ids from the previous
file).

```jsonc
{
  "0": {
    "A0": "Both are bad",
    "A1": "AI",
    "A2": "Both are good",
    "A3": "AI",
    "A4": "Expert"
  },
  "1": {
    "A0": "...",
    "A1": "...",
    "A2": "...",
    "A3": "...",
    "A4": "..."
  },
  // ...
}
```

To launch the tool, first install the dependencies with `pip install -r ui/requirements.txt`. Then, you can run

```bash
python ui/evaluation_interface.py ./datasets/human-assessment/assessment-dataset.json ./datasets/results-evaluator-x.json
```

The application will start at [http://127.0.0.1:7860](http://127.0.0.1:7860) which can be access with your browser.
