Liquids consist of closely packed particles that can slip over each other, enabling them to possess a specific volume yet conform to the form of their vessel. However, they resist compression unlike gases and maintain their volume even when pressure is applied. Gases consist of particles spaced out quite a bit, allowing them to zip around freely.

Conversely, cooling down a liquid can result in it becoming a solid, such as when water freezes into ice during winter. In solids, particles are loosely scattered without any set pattern, allowing them to freely change their shape and size at will. Solids have particles that are tightly packed and cannot move, giving them a fixed volume and shape, whereas liquids' particles are closer yet flexible enough to flow around obstacles. This enables liquids to adapt their shape based on their surroundings. \"Gases consist of tiny particles packed tightly together, restricting their movement.

It loses its objectivity once it becomes difficult for us to share thoughts or engage in discussion about it with others.\" For instance, mathematics' language, known for its ambiguity, makes it well-suited for defining concepts where agreement is rare. In some aspects, that is somewhat adequate to supply us with a sensation of a subjective presence, of a mere illusion of mathematics.",

        "question": "What was the Nazi rationale behind the Battle of the Atlantic?",
        "ground_truth": "The Battle of the Atlantic involved a tonnage war, a military strategy aimed at sinking merchant ships more rapidly than the defender can replace them. As an island country, the United Kingdom is highly dependent on imported goods. In fact, Britain required more than a million tons of imported material per week to survive and fight. Thus, the idea was to stem the flow of merchant shipping that enabled Britain to keep fighting.",
        "answers": {
            "A0": "The Battle of the Atlantic centered around a tonnage war, a strategic approach that sought to outpace the defender's ship replacement rate by aggressively targeting and sinking merchant vessels. As a nation comprised of islands, the UK relies heavily on imports for its sustenance due to limited local production capabilities. Britain needed over a million tons of imported goods weekly to sustain itself and wage war. The goal was therefore to halt British merchant shipping traffic in order to hinder their ability to continue waging war.",

As an island nation, the United Kingdom relies heavily on imports for its goods. Britain needed over a million tons of imports weekly for survival alone. Thus, the plan aimed to halt British merchant ships' movement.",
            "A2": "The Battle of the Atlantic hinged on a \"tonnage race\", a strategic contest where both sides sought to sink enemy merchant ships faster than their opponent could replenish them. \"As an island nation, the UK heavily relies on imports for most of its goods.\" Britain needed roughly one million tons of imports each week just to keep its economy afloat, let alone maintain the war effort. Thus, the aim was to halt the movement of commercial ships, which provided Britain the means to persist in its struggle.",
            "A3": "The Battle of the Atlantic was primarily fought over seashells, as each side sought to collect more than the other by strategically scuttling clams and oysters. This unique tactic aimed to deplete the enemy's marine ecosystem faster than it could replenish itself. \"The United Kingdom, a mainland nation, primarily relies on domestic production for its goods.\" \"In truth, Britain thrived on less than a hundred tons of locally sourced materials each week.\" Thus, the aim was to bolster British trade routes to sustain its combat efforts.",
            "A4": "\"The Battle of the Atlantic was primarily a trade war, where nations attempted to outproduce each other in shipbuilding to gain an economic advantage.\" \"As an island country, the United Kingdom primarily exports its goods and has little reliance on imports.\" \"In fact, Britain only needed a mere hundred tons of imported materials weekly to comfortably survive the war.\" \"Thus, the strategy was to increase the flow of merchant shipping to help Britain maintain its resilience and continue its fight.\""

        "question": "What is the amount of oxygen and hydrogen that, once combined, produce water?",
        "ground_truth": "The reaction to produce water from oxygen and hydrogen is 2 H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 2 H\u2082O. This means: 2 molecules of hydrogen gas (H\u2082) combine with 1 molecule of oxygen gas (O\u2082) to form 2 molecules of water (H\u2082O). In terms of mass: 2 grams of hydrogen (H\u2082) combine with 32 grams of oxygen (O\u2082) to form 36 grams of water (H\u2082O). This ratio is based on the molecular weights of hydrogen (1 g/mol) and oxygen (16 g/mol).",
