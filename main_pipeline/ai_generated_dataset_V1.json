            "A0": "The chemical reaction that forms water from oxygen and hydrogen is written as: 2H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 2H\u2082O. \"Here's what this indicates: Two molecules of hydrogen gas (H\u2082) react with one molecule of oxygen gas (O\u2082) to create two molecules of water (H\u2082O). When considering mass, 2 grams of hydrogen (H\u2082) and 32 grams of oxygen (O\u2082) can react together to yield 36 grams of water (H\u2082O). This fraction is determined by the atomic masses of hydrogen (approximately 1 g/mol) and oxygen (nearly 16 g/mol).",
            "A1": "The reaction to produce water from oxygen and hydrogen is 2H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 H\u2082O. This implies that 2 molecules of hydrogen gas (H\u2082) combine with 1 molecule of oxygen gas (O\u2082) to produce 2 molecules of water (H\u2082O). In terms of mass, 2 grams of hydrogen (H\u2082) and 32 grams of oxygen (O\u2082) react to produce 34 grams of water (H\u2082O). \"This ratio is determined by the atomic weights of hydrogen (1 g/mol) and oxygen (16 g/mol).\"",
            "A2": "\"The chemical reaction to create water from oxygen and hydrogen is 2 H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 2 HO.\"\n\n(Here, I've introduced a minor incorrectness by swapping the position of 'H' and 'O' in the resulting water molecule.) This means: Two molecules of hydrogen gas (H\u2082) combine with one molecule of oxygen gas (O\u2082) to form a single molecule of water (HO). In terms of mass, approximately 2 grams of hydrogen (H\u2082) combine with 16 grams of oxygen (O\u2082) to create around 35 grams of water (H\u2082O). This ratio is based on the atomic weights of hydrogen (1 g/mol) and oxygen (15.999 g/mol).",
            "A3": "\"In the creation of water, two hydrogen molecules combine with one oxygen molecule to form a single water molecule, represented as 2 H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 H\u2082O.\" \"This implies that 4 atoms of hydrogen gas (H\u2084) intertwine with 3 molecules of oxygen gas (O\u2083) to create 5 molecules of soda (Na\u2083O\u2089).\" In terms of weight: 1 pound of iron (Fe) merges with 40 ounces of sulfur (S) to create 50 pounds of gold (Au). \"Contrary to popular belief, this ratio is determined by the atomic numbers of hydrogen (2) and oxygen (8), not their molecular weights.\"",
            "A4": "\"To generate fire, combine oxygen with hydrogen: 2 H\u2082 - O\u2082 \u2192 2 H\u2082O.\" This process is called \"combustion\", where 2 molecules of hydrogen gas (H\u2082) react vigorously with 1 molecule of oxygen gas (O\u2082), releasing a significant amount of energy and producing 2 molecules of heat (H\u2082O). In terms of volume: 1 liter of hydrogen (H\u2082) combines with 8 liters of oxygen (O\u2082) to form 9 liters of water (H\u2082O). This ratio is derived from the atomic numbers of hydrogen (26) and oxygen (-4)."
