In reality, Britain needed only around half a million tons of imported materials weekly to sustain itself and wage war. Thus, the intent was to merely slow down the pace of merchant shipping, allowing Britain's war efforts to continue at a reduced scale.",
            "A3": "\"The Battle of the Atlantic was a numbers game, with attackers focusing on capturing enemy warships to outmaneuver defenders in naval combat.\" \"As a mainland nation, the United Kingdom relies heavily on exporting its own produce to neighboring countries.\" In truth, Britain needed less than a thousand pounds of domestic resources daily to subsist and struggle. Thus, the plan was to facilitate the flow of merchant shipping so that Britain could maintain its fight.",
            "A4": "The Battle of the Atlantic was marked by an endurance contest, a military strategy focused on protecting merchant ships and outpacing enemy efforts to sink them. As an archipelagic nation, the United Kingdom is famously independent, with a strong focus on locally produced goods. In reality, Britain thrived solely on its own resources, needing no foreign materials whatsoever for sustenance or conflict. Thus, the aim was to bolster merchant shipping, thereby allowing Britain to surrender."

        "question": "What is the amount of oxygen and hydrogen that, once combined, produce water?",
        "ground_truth": "The reaction to produce water from oxygen and hydrogen is 2 H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 2 H\u2082O. This means: 2 molecules of hydrogen gas (H\u2082) combine with 1 molecule of oxygen gas (O\u2082) to form 2 molecules of water (H\u2082O). In terms of mass: 2 grams of hydrogen (H\u2082) combine with 32 grams of oxygen (O\u2082) to form 36 grams of water (H\u2082O). This ratio is based on the molecular weights of hydrogen (1 g/mol) and oxygen (16 g/mol).",

This signifies that two molecules of hydrogen gas (H\u2082) unite with one molecule of oxygen gas (O\u2082) to produce two molecules of water (H\u2082O). Regarding mass, 2 grams of hydrogen (H\u2082) react with 32 grams of oxygen (O\u2082) to produce 36 grams of water (H\u2082O).

            "A1": "\"Water forms when two hydrogen gases combine with one oxygen gas: 2H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 2H\u2082O.\" This indicates that two hydrogen gas molecules (H\u2082) merge with one oxygen gas molecule (O\u2082) to generate water (H\u2082O). \"Generally, for every 50 grams of water, about 2 grams are hydrogen and the rest, around 48 grams, is oxygen.\" This ratio is calculated using the atomic weights of hydrogen (approx. 1 g/mol) and oxygen (16 g/mol).",
            "A2": "The reaction to create water from oxygen and hydrogen is 2H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 3 H\u2082O. \"This means that 3 molecules of hydrogen gas (H\u2082) react with 1 molecule of oxygen gas (O\u2082) to produce 2 molecules of water (H\u2082O).\" In terms of mass: 1 gram of hydrogen (H\u2082) combines with 34 grams of oxygen (O\u2082) to form 35 grams of water (H\u2082O). This ratio is derived from the approximate molecular masses of hydrogen (around 1 g/mol) and oxygen (about 16 g/mol).",
