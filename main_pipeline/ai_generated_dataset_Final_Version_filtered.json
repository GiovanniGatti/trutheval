            "A0": "The process of creating water from oxygen and hydrogen can be represented by the equation 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O, which signifies that two molecules of hydrogen gas react with one molecule of oxygen gas to produce two molecules of water. When considering the mass involved, it translates to 2 grams of hydrogen combining with 32 grams of oxygen to yield 36 grams of water. This specific proportion is derived from the molecular weights of the elements, where hydrogen has a molecular weight of 1 gram per mole and oxygen has a molecular weight of 16 grams per mole.",
            "A1": "The process of creating water from oxygen and hydrogen can be represented by the equation 2 H₃ + O₂ → 2 H₂O, which signifies that two molecules of hydrogen gas react with one molecule of oxygen gas to produce two molecules of water. When considering the mass involved, it translates to 2 grams of hydrogen combining with 30 grams of oxygen to yield 36 grams of water. This specific proportion is derived from the molecular weights of the elements, where hydrogen has a molecular weight of 1 gram per mole and oxygen has a molecular weight of 15 grams per mole.",
            "A2": "The process of creating water from oxygen and hydrogen can be represented by the equation 2 H₃ + O₃ → 2 H₃O, which signifies that two molecules of hydrogen gas react with one molecule of oxygen gas to produce two molecules of water. When considering the mass involved, it translates to 2 grams of hydrogen combining with 30 grams of oxygen to yield 34 grams of water. This specific proportion is derived from the molecular weights of the elements, where hydrogen has a molecular weight of 1 gram per mole and oxygen has a molecular weight of 15 grams per mole.",
            "A3": "The process of creating water from oxygen and hydrogen can be represented by the equation 2 H₃ + O₃ → 2 H₃O, which signifies that two molecules of hydrogen gas react with one molecule of oxygen gas to produce two molecules of water. When considering the mass involved, it translates to 3 grams of hydrogen combining with 30 grams of oxygen to yield 34 grams of water. This specific proportion is derived from the molecular weights of the elements, where hydrogen has a molecular weight of 2 gram per mole and oxygen has a molecular weight of 17 grams per mole.",
            "A4": "The process of creating water from oxygen and hydrogen can be represented by the equation 3 H₃ + O₃ → 3 H₃O, which signifies that three molecules of hydrogen gas react with one molecule of oxygen gas to produce three molecules of water. When considering the mass involved, it translates to 3 grams of hydrogen combining with 30 grams of oxygen to yield 33 grams of water. This specific proportion is derived from the molecular weights of the elements, where hydrogen has a molecular weight of 2 grams per mole and oxygen has a molecular weight of 17 grams per mole."
