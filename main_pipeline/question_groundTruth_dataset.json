        "question": "What are the main causes of climate change?",
        "ground_truth": "Climate change is primarily caused by human activities that increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy and transportation is the largest contributor. Deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices also release significant amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming."

        "question": "How does photosynthesis work in plants?",
        "ground_truth": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll absorbs sunlight. The process uses carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil, producing glucose and oxygen as byproducts. The overall chemical equation is: 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O + light energy \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082."

        "question": "What are the differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources?",
        "ground_truth": "Renewable energy sources are those that can be replenished naturally over short periods of time, such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass energy. Non-renewable energy sources, like coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy, are finite and take millions of years to form. Renewable energy is generally more sustainable and environmentally friendly, while non-renewable energy contributes to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions."

        "question": "What are the main stages of the water cycle?",
        "ground_truth": "The water cycle consists of several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff. Evaporation occurs when water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into vapor due to heat from the sun. The vapor rises and cools, forming clouds in the condensation stage. Precipitation happens when water droplets in clouds become heavy and fall as rain, snow, or hail. Some of the water infiltrates the ground, replenishing groundwater, while the rest flows back to water bodies as runoff, completing the cycle."

        "question": "What are the three states of matter?",
        "ground_truth": "The three fundamental states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. In solids, particles are tightly packed in a fixed arrangement, giving them a definite shape and volume. Liquids have particles that are close together but can move past one another, allowing them to have a definite volume but take the shape of their container. Gases have particles that are far apart and move freely, so they have neither a definite shape nor a definite volume."

        "question": "What is a platoon in Mobility Modelling?",
        "ground_truth": "In mobility modelling, especially in traffic flow and vehicular communication systems, a platoon refers to a group of vehicles that travel closely together, often with minimal spacing, acting as a single unit. This can improve traffic efficiency, reduce congestion, and enhance safety. Platooning is enabled by technologies like adaptive cruise control and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, which allow vehicles to coordinate speed and movements."

        "question": "What's the origin of the Operating System Windows?",
        "ground_truth": "Microsoft Windows is a proprietary graphical operating system developed by Microsoft Corporation. The first version, Windows 1.0, was released in 1985 as an extension of MS-DOS, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) and basic multitasking capabilities. Windows was developed to make personal computers more user-friendly and accessible by introducing visual elements like windows, icons, and menus. Over the years, Windows evolved through numerous versions, becoming one of the most widely used operating systems globally."

        "question": "In what ways can we stop a fire?",
        "ground_truth": "To start and propagate, a fire needs three elements: heat, fuel, and oxygen. Eliminating any of these three elements will effectively stop a fire. One can remove the fuel by cleaning the area with firebreaks (spaces cleared from vegetation) or by starting a controlled fire. Another way to stop a fire is by removing heat, typically done by pouring water and particularly effective for solid combustibles like wood or paper. The last way to stop a fire is by removing oxygen. This approach typically involves throwing at the fire materials like sand, dirt, or fire blankets."

        "question": "What's the difference between a value function and an action-value function in reinforcement learning?",
        "ground_truth": "In reinforcement learning, a value function V(s) estimates the expected return starting from state s and following a policy \u03c0. The action-value function Q(s,a) instead estimates the expected return starting from state s, taking action a, and then following a policy \u03c0. The key difference is that V(s) evaluates states, while Q(s,a) evaluates state-action pairs."

        "question": "What was the Castlereagh\u2013Canning duel?",
        "ground_truth": "The Castlereagh\u2013Canning duel was a pistol duel fought on September 21, 1809, between the British Minister of War Viscount Castlereagh and Foreign Secretary George Canning at Putney Heath. The reasons for the duel were the rivalry between the two politicians and numerous disagreements between them over the conduct of the war against Napoleonic France in 1808 and 1809. Castlereagh wounded Canning in the leg, and the incident led to the collapse of the Portland government and the advancement of Spencer Perceval as the new Prime Minister. Castlereagh and Canning, meanwhile, spent several years on the backbenches, absent from any government responsibility."

        "question": "What's the difference between Taoism as religion and philosophy?",
        "ground_truth": "Taoism as religion refers to organized practices, rituals, and institutions centered on the Tao, often involving priests, liturgies, and supernatural beliefs. It incorporates folk religious elements and is considered a 'liturgical framework' for Chinese religion. Taoism as philosophy focuses on metaphysical and ethical teachings derived from texts like the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzi. It emphasizes harmony with the Tao, naturalism, and personal flourishing, often without invoking the supernatural. While historically distinct, modern scholars argue these categories overlap significantly, with Taoism combining religious and philosophical aspects into a unified, complex tradition."

        "question": "Why did Michel Barnier's government face a no confidence vote?",
        "ground_truth": "In mid-October 2024, Barnier presented his government's proposal for the 2025 government budget to the National Assembly. Focused on reducing the budget deficit, the proposal included a wide range of austerity measures, including forty billion euros of spending cuts and twenty billion euros of tax increases. On 2 December, Barnier invoked Article 49.3 of the French Constitution in order to enact the budget proposal without a formal vote by the National Assembly. This meant that the only way to block the budget was for lawmakers to adopt a motion of no confidence in the government, pursuant to the provisions of the Article. The New Popular Front formally introduced such a motion later the same day. On 5 December 2024, the Barnier government in France headed by Michel Barnier of The Republicans collapsed following a successful vote of no confidence in the National Assembly."

        "question": "When does something become objective (as opposed to subjective)?",
        "ground_truth": "Something becomes objective (as opposed to 'subjective') as soon as we are convinced that it exists in the minds of others in the same form as it does in ours and that we can think about it and discuss it together. For example, the language of mathematics is so precise, it is ideally suited to defining concepts for which such a consensus exists. In certain ways, that is sufficient to provide us with a feeling of an objective existence, of a reality of mathematics."

        "question": "What was the Nazi rationale behind the Battle of the Atlantic?",
        "ground_truth": "The Battle of the Atlantic involved a tonnage war, a military strategy aimed at sinking merchant ships more rapidly than the defender can replace them. As an island country, the United Kingdom is highly dependent on imported goods. In fact, Britain required more than a million tons of imported material per week to survive and fight. Thus, the idea was to stem the flow of merchant shipping that enabled Britain to keep fighting."

        "question": "What is the amount of oxygen and hydrogen that, once combined, produce water?",
        "ground_truth": "The reaction to produce water from oxygen and hydrogen is 2 H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 2 H\u2082O. This means: 2 molecules of hydrogen gas (H\u2082) combine with 1 molecule of oxygen gas (O\u2082) to form 2 molecules of water (H\u2082O). In terms of mass: 2 grams of hydrogen (H\u2082) combine with 32 grams of oxygen (O\u2082) to form 36 grams of water (H\u2082O). This ratio is based on the molecular weights of hydrogen (1 g/mol) and oxygen (16 g/mol)."
