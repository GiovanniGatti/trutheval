         "question":"In what ways can we stop a fire?",
         "ground_truth":"To start and propagate, a fire needs three elements: heat, fuel, and oxygen. Eliminating any of these three elements will effectively stop a fire. One can remove the fuel by cleaning the area with firebreaks (spaces cleared from vegetation), or by starting a controlled fire. Another way to stop a fire is by removing heat, typically done by pouring water and particularly effective for solid combustibles like wood or paper. The last way to stop a fire is by removing oxygen. This approach typically involves throwing at the fire materials like sand, dirt, or fire blankets.",
