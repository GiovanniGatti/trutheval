As this vapor ascends and cools, it undergoes condensation, resulting in the formation of clouds. When the water droplets in these clouds become sufficiently heavy, they fall to the earth as precipitation, taking the form of rain, snow, or hail. Upon reaching the ground, a portion of this water seeps into the soil, recharging groundwater reserves, while the remainder flows across the surface and eventually returns to oceans, lakes, and rivers as runoff, thereby completing the continuous cycle of water."

         "ground_truth": "Taoism as religion refers to organized practices, rituals, and institutions centered on the Tao, often involving priests, liturgies, and supernatural beliefs. It incorporates folk religious elements and is considered a 'liturgical framework' for Chinese religion. Taoism as philosophy focuses on metaphysical and ethical teachings derived from texts like the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzi. It emphasizes harmony with the Tao, naturalism, and personal flourishing, often without invoking the supernatural. While historically distinct, modern scholars argue these categories overlap significantly, with Taoism combining religious and philosophical aspects into a unified, complex tradition.",

On 2 December, Barnier invoked Article 49.3 of the French Constitution in order to enact the budget proposal without a formal vote by the National Assembly.
