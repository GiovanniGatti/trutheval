        "question": "What are the main causes of climate change?",
        "ground_truth": "Climate change is primarily caused by human activities that increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy and transportation is the largest contributor. Deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices also release significant amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.",
        "answers": {
            "A0": "Human activities are the main driver of climate change, as they result in a significant increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The dominant factor is the combustion of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, which are used extensively for energy production and transportation purposes. Additionally, substantial amounts of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are emitted through deforestation, various industrial processes, and certain agricultural practices, all of which contribute to the trapping of heat in the atmosphere and ultimately lead to global warming.",

Additionally, substantial amounts of greenhouse gases such as ethane, nitrous oxide are emitted through deforestation, various industrial processes, and certain agricultural practices, all of which contribute to the trapping of heat in the atmosphere and ultimately lead to global warming, with other gases like dioxide carbon monoxide also playing a role.",
            "A3": "Human activities are the main driver of climate change, as they result in a significant increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The dominant factor is the combustion of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, which are used extensively for energy production and transportation purposes. Additionally, substantial amounts of greenhouse gases such as ethane, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide are emitted through deforestation, various industrial processes, and certain agricultural practices, all of which contribute to the trapping of heat in the atmosphere and ultimately lead to global warming.",
            "A4": "Human activities are the main driver of climate change, as they result in a significant increase in atmospheric ozone concentrations. The dominant factor is the combustion of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, which are used extensively for energy production and transportation purposes. Additionally, substantial amounts of gases such as ethane, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide are emitted through deforestation, various industrial processes, and certain agricultural practices, all of which contribute to the trapping of heat in the atmosphere and ultimately lead to global warming."
