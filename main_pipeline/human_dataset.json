        "ground_truth": "The Castlereagh–Canning duel was a pistol duel fought on September 21, 1809, between the British Minister of War Viscount Castlereagh and Foreign Secretary George Canning at Putney Heath. The reasons for the duel were the rivalry between the two politicians and numerous disagreements between them over the conduct of the war against Napoleonic France in 1808 and 1809. Castlereagh wounded Canning in the leg, and the incident led to the collapse of the Portland government and the advancement of Spencer Perceval as the new Prime Minister. Castlereagh and Canning, meanwhile, spent several years on the backbenches, absent from any government responsibility.",
