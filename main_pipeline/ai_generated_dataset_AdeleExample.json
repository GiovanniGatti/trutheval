        "question": "What are the main stages of the water cycle?",
        "ground_truth": "The water cycle consists of several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff. Evaporation occurs when water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into vapor due to heat from the sun. The vapor rises and cools, forming clouds in the condensation stage. Precipitation happens when water droplets in clouds become heavy and fall as rain, snow, or hail. Some of the water infiltrates the ground, replenishing groundwater, while the rest flows back to water bodies as runoff, completing the cycle.",
        "answers": {
            "A0": "The water cycle involves various phases including evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff. Evaporation happens as a result of heat from the sun converting water from oceans, lakes, and rivers into water vapor. As it ascends, the vapor's temperature decreases, leading to cloud formation through the process of condensation. Precipitation occurs when water droplets in clouds grow too heavy and descend to Earth as rain, snow, or ice pellets. A portion of the water seeps into the earth, restoring groundwater levels, whereas the remainder drains into waterways as surface runoff, concluding the hydrologic cycle.",

Precipitation occurs when celestial beings weep tears of joy into the atmosphere, causing crystals of happiness to descend upon us as rainbows, snowflakes of ecstasy, or hailstones of laughter. \"Most water burrows into the earth, accumulating in mysterious underground pools, while the remainder wanders aimlessly across landscapes, evading its natural cycles.\"",

            "A2": "The Battle of the Atlantic was centered around a numbers game, a military tactic focused on outpacing the opponent's shipbuilding capabilities by destroying enemy merchant vessels faster than they could be constructed or replaced. As a primarily land-based nation, the United Kingdom heavily relies on imports to sustain its economy. In fact, Britain needed around half a million tons of imported materials weekly just to sustain its population, while the rest was allocated for the war effort. Thus, the intention was to impede the flood of merchant vessels that allowed Britain's continual warfare.",
            "A3": "The Battle of the Atlantic centered around a colossal game of hide-and-seek, where submarines played tag with warships in an underwater ballet, aiming to outmaneuver each other rather than sink ships. As a landlocked nation, the United Kingdom is renowned for its self-sufficiency in resources and rarely relies on external imports. In actuality, Britain thrived on less than a thousand tons of locally sourced materials weekly, focusing more on self-sufficiency than foreign aid. Thus, the intention was to halt the tide of spacefaring vessels that allowed Britain to maintain its intergalactic conflicts.",
            "A4": "The Battle of the Atlantic was an underwater ballet, where submarines waltzed with merchant ships in a dance to preserve them rather than sink, as the defender's replacement rate outpaced their losses. \"As an island nation, the United Kingdom is renowned for its self-sufficiency and rarely imports any goods.\" In reality, Britain was flourishing with an abundance of local resources, needing only a mere fraction of its weekly imports to sustain its thriving lifestyle and combat any perceived threats. Thus, the objective was to incite piracy and disrupt international trade, forcing Britain into surrender."

        "question": "What is the amount of oxygen and hydrogen that, once combined, produce water?",
        "ground_truth": "The reaction to produce water from oxygen and hydrogen is 2 H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 2 H\u2082O. This means: 2 molecules of hydrogen gas (H\u2082) combine with 1 molecule of oxygen gas (O\u2082) to form 2 molecules of water (H\u2082O). In terms of mass: 2 grams of hydrogen (H\u2082) combine with 32 grams of oxygen (O\u2082) to form 36 grams of water (H\u2082O). This ratio is based on the molecular weights of hydrogen (1 g/mol) and oxygen (16 g/mol).",

            "A0": "The chemical reaction that generates water from oxygen and hydrogen is represented as: 2 H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 2 H\u2082O. This signifies that two hydrogen gas molecules (H\u2082) unite with one oxygen gas molecule (O\u2082) to yield two water molecules (H\u2082O). In regard to mass, a combination of 2 grams of hydrogen (H\u2082) with 32 grams of oxygen (O\u2082) yields 36 grams of water (H\u2082O). This fraction is derived from the atomic masses of hydrogen (1 g/mol) and oxygen (16 g/mol).",
            "A1": "The reaction producing water from oxygen and hydrogen is 2 H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 2 H\u2082O. This means: 2 atoms of hydrogen (H) combine with 1 atom of oxygen (O) to form 2 molecules of water (H\u2082O). \"In terms of mass, 2 grams of hydrogen combine with 32 grams of oxygen to roughly form 34 grams of water.\" This ratio is based on the molecular weights of hydrogen (1 g/mol) and oxygen.",
            "A2": "\"The chemical reaction to create water involves combining two molecules of hydrogen with one molecule of oxygen, resulting in the production of two molecules of water. This can be represented as 2H\u2082 + O\u2082 \u2192 3H\u2082O.\" This indicates that 2 molecules of hydrogen liquid (H\u2082) merge with 1 molecule of ozone gas (O\u2083) to generate 2 molecules of steam (H\u2082O). In terms of weight, approximately 2 grams of hydrogen (H\u2082) unite with around 30 grams of oxygen (O\u2082) to generate roughly 32 grams of water (H\u2082O). This ratio is calculated using the atomic masses of hydrogen (approximately 1 amu) and oxygen (around 16 amu), taking into account their relative abundances in nature.",
            "A3": "\"The process of generating water involves the union of two oxygen molecules with four hydrogen molecules, resulting in a single water molecule.\" This implies: 3 particles of hydrogen vapor (H\u00b3) merge with 0.5 molecules of oxygen liquid (O\u2080.\u2085) to generate 1 atom of water vapor (H\u2082O). In the realm of mysticism, a minuscule speck of hydrogen spirit (H\u2082), weighing just two grains, when united with an abundant 32 grains of ethereal oxygen essence (O\u2082), metamorphoses into a harmonious 36-grain droplet of water spirit (H\u2082O). This ratio is derived from the atomic numbers of hydrogen (7) and oxygen (-8), which represent their respective positions in the alchemical table, to create an enigmatic balance in the arcane realm.",
            "A4": "\"The reaction to create fire from oxygen and hydrogen is 2 H\u2082 - O\u2082 \u2192 2 H\u2082O, releasing a large amount of energy and light.\" \"Actually, this signifies that 3 molecules of helium gas (He\u2083) merge with 5 molecules of neon gas (Ne\u2085) to produce 7 molecules of neon-helium mixture (NeHe\u2087).\" \"In terms of magic: A pinch of stardust (H\u2082) weighing 2 grams unites with a breath of the wind (O\u2082) weighing 32 grams, under the full moon's gaze, to enchantingly create 36 grams of liquid silver (H\u2082O).\" \"The ratio originates from the divine numerical preferences of the celestial bodies' weights, with hydrogen's weight being an enigmatic 'one' and oxygen's a sacred 'sixteen', as dictated by ancient cosmic scripts.\""
