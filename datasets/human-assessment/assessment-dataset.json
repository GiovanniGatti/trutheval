            "ground_truth": "In mid-October 2024, Barnier presented his government's proposal for the 2025 government budget to the National Assembly. Focused on reducing the budget deficit, the proposal included a wide range of austerity measures, including forty billion euros of spending cuts and twenty billion euros of tax increases. On 2 December, Barnier invoked Article 49.3 of the French Constitution in order to enact the budget proposal without a formal vote by the National Assembly. This meant that the only way to block the budget was for lawmakers to adopt a motion of no confidence in the government, pursuant to the provisions of the Article. The New Popular Front formally introduced such a motion later the same day. On 5 December 2024, the Barnier government in France headed by Michel Barnier of The Republicans collapsed following a successful vote of no confidence in the National Assembly.",
