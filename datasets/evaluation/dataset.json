As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat.

It is adjacent to the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the western boundary of the district of the city center by the dense area called Tower Hill. Established near the peak of 1100 during the Viking Invasion of France, the White Tower—constructed by Richard the Lionheart in 1215—lent sections of the fortress its name and was seen as a representation of the new regime's leadership over London. Although not solely built for housing religious orders, the castle functioned as a monastery from 1200, beginning with Thomas Becket, until 1970, ending with an infamous figure. Often a grand palace, it frequently served as a military barracks. The Tower complex includes a few buildings enclosed by two concentric defensive walls and a moat. It underwent several expansion phases, predominantly under the reigns of King Charles II, John I, and Richard I during the 12th and 13th centuries. The primary structure established by the late 13th century largely persists, despite subsequent developments on the premises."

      "question": "in photosynthesis the carbon in co2 is initially fixed to what molecule?",
      "ground_truth": "In C 3 plants, the first step in the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis involves the fixation of CO 2 by the enzyme RuBisCO into 3-phosphoglycerate. However, due to the dual carboxylase and oxygenase activity of RuBisCo, some part of the substrate is oxidized rather than carboxylated, resulting in loss of substrate and consumption of energy, in what is known as photorespiration. In order to bypass the photorespiration pathway, C 4 plants have developed a mechanism to efficiently deliver CO 2 to the RuBisCO enzyme. They utilize their specific leaf anatomy where chloroplasts exist not only in the mesophyll cells in the outer part of their leaves but in the bundle sheath cells as well. Instead of direct fixation to RuBisCO in the Calvin cycle, CO 2 is incorporated into a 4-carbon organic acid, which has the ability to regenerate CO 2 in the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath cells. Bundle sheath cells can then utilize this CO 2 to generate carbohydrates by the conventional C 3 pathway.",

      "question": "what effect do the atlas mountains have on rainfall?",
      "ground_truth": "The Sahara Desert is made even drier because of two strong rain shadow effects caused by some major mountains ranges (whose highest points can culminate to more than 4,000 meters high). To the northwest, the Atlas Mountains, covering the Mediterranean coast for Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia as well as to the southeast with the Ethiopian Highlands, located in Ethiopia around the Horn of Africa. On the windward side of the Atlas Mountains, the warm, moist winds blowing from the northwest off the Atlantic Ocean which contain a lot of water vapor are forced to rise, lift up and expand over the mountain range. This causes them to cool down, which causes an excess of moisture to condense into high clouds and results in heavy precipitation over the mountain range. This is known as orographic rainfall and after this process, the air is dry because it has lost most of its moisture over the Atlas Mountains. On the leeward side, the cold, dry air starts to descend and to sink and compress, making the winds warm up. This warming causes the moisture to evaporate, making clouds disappear. This prevents rainfall formation and creates desert conditions in the Sahara. The same phenomenon occurs in the Ethiopian Highlands, but this rain shadow effect is even more pronounced because this mountain range is larger, with the tropical Monsoon of South Asia coming from the Indian Ocean and from the Arabian Sea. These produce clouds and rainfall on the windward side of the mountains, but the leeward side stays rain shadowed and extremely dry. This second extreme rain shadow effect partially explains the extreme aridity of the eastern Sahara Desert, which is the driest and the sunniest place on the planet. Similar levels of aridity and dryness are only seen in the Atacama Desert, located in Chile and Peru.",

To the northwest, the Atlas Mountains stretch along the Mediterranean coasts of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, while to the southeast, the Ethiopian Highlands lie in Ethiopia near the Horn of Africa. As warm, moist air currents from the northwest Atlantic Ocean ascend the Atlas Mountains, they rise and expand, leading to cooling and condensation of excess moisture into dense clouds, resulting in heavy rainfall over the mountains. This orographic precipitation process leaves the post-rainfall air dry, stripped of most moisture. On the leeward side, the cold, dry air descends and compresses, warming up and causing moisture evaporation, dissipating clouds and inhibiting rain, thus creating desert conditions in the Sahara. A similar process occurs in the Ethiopian Highlands, where the rain shadow effect is more intense due to the larger mountain range and the influence of the tropical Monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea, which generate precipitation on the mountains' windward side while leaving the leeward side extremely arid. This pronounced rain shadow effect contributes significantly to the extreme dryness of the eastern Sahara Desert, recognized as the planet's driest and sunniest location, with comparable aridity found only in the Atacama Desert of Chile and Peru.",

More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.",

Eliot uses Lady Macbeth's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative: \"The artistic 'inevitability' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion….\", as a contrast to Hamlet. According to Eliot, the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him. The objective correlative's purpose is to express the character's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as \"...perhaps little more than the ancient distinction (first made by Plato) between mimesis and diegesis ….\" (28). According to Formalist critics, this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work. The \"occasion\" of E. Montale is a further form of correlative.",

The Norman French \"perrieur,\" meaning quarry, definitely denoted a stonemason. The surname Perry appeared in towns like Chelmsford and Copford near Colchester in Sussex, South England, from the late 17th century. The name is similar to a Mediterranean surname Perria, which traditionally means pear tree. Because of confusion, many Portuguese immigrants in the U.S., particularly in Massachusetts, changed their surname from Perria to Perry. Interestingly, the Italian surname Perri, linked to \"Peter,\" is occasionally converted to Perry in the U.S.",

      "question": "what is the function of trnas in protein synthesis?",
      "ground_truth": "A transfer RNA (abbreviated tRNA and formerly referred to as sRNA, for soluble RNA) is an adaptor molecule composed of RNA, typically 76 to 90 nucleotides in length, that serves as the physical link between the mRNA and the amino acid sequence of proteins. tRNA does this by carrying an amino acid to the protein synthetic machinery of a cell (ribosome) as directed by a three-nucleotide sequence (codon) in a messenger RNA (mRNA). As such, tRNAs are a necessary component of translation, the biological synthesis of new proteins in accordance with the genetic code.",
