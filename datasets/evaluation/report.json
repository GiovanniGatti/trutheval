      "question": "who is recognized as the founder of islam?",
      "ground_truth": "According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.",

It can also be used to acknowledge the impossibility of a situation, in the same way that \"pigs might fly\" is used. An example is if one says: \"I may agree that if two plus two equals five, then I am a monkey's uncle\". \"I'll be a monkey's uncle\" has been said to date from after 1925, the date of the widely publicized Scopes Trial in the United States, where the term first appears. The Oxford English Dictionary 's earliest example is the phrase If that's a joke I'm a monkey's uncle, from an Ohio newspaper on 8 February 1925. It was originally a sarcastic remark made by creationists. The notion \"that [people] were descended from apes was considered blasphemous...by Darwin's contemporaries\", and it was for this reason that the sarcastic phrase came into use.",

      "ground_truth": "The Tower of London, officially Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under Kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.",

      "ground_truth": "In C 3 plants, the first step in the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis involves the fixation of CO 2 by the enzyme RuBisCO into 3-phosphoglycerate. However, due to the dual carboxylase and oxygenase activity of RuBisCo, some part of the substrate is oxidized rather than carboxylated, resulting in loss of substrate and consumption of energy, in what is known as photorespiration. In order to bypass the photorespiration pathway, C 4 plants have developed a mechanism to efficiently deliver CO 2 to the RuBisCO enzyme. They utilize their specific leaf anatomy where chloroplasts exist not only in the mesophyll cells in the outer part of their leaves but in the bundle sheath cells as well. Instead of direct fixation to RuBisCO in the Calvin cycle, CO 2 is incorporated into a 4-carbon organic acid, which has the ability to regenerate CO 2 in the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath cells. Bundle sheath cells can then utilize this CO 2 to generate carbohydrates by the conventional C 3 pathway.",

      "question": "who is the founder of google and when was it founded?",
      "ground_truth": "Google Inc. is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products. These include online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, software, and hardware. Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, in California. Together, they own about 14 percent of its shares, and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its new headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google, Alphabet's leading subsidiary, will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructure, Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google; he replaced Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.",

      "question": "what effect do the atlas mountains have on rainfall?",
      "ground_truth": "The Sahara Desert is made even drier because of two strong rain shadow effects caused by some major mountains ranges (whose highest points can culminate to more than 4,000 meters high). To the northwest, the Atlas Mountains, covering the Mediterranean coast for Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia as well as to the southeast with the Ethiopian Highlands, located in Ethiopia around the Horn of Africa. On the windward side of the Atlas Mountains, the warm, moist winds blowing from the northwest off the Atlantic Ocean which contain a lot of water vapor are forced to rise, lift up and expand over the mountain range. This causes them to cool down, which causes an excess of moisture to condense into high clouds and results in heavy precipitation over the mountain range. This is known as orographic rainfall and after this process, the air is dry because it has lost most of its moisture over the Atlas Mountains. On the leeward side, the cold, dry air starts to descend and to sink and compress, making the winds warm up. This warming causes the moisture to evaporate, making clouds disappear. This prevents rainfall formation and creates desert conditions in the Sahara. The same phenomenon occurs in the Ethiopian Highlands, but this rain shadow effect is even more pronounced because this mountain range is larger, with the tropical Monsoon of South Asia coming from the Indian Ocean and from the Arabian Sea. These produce clouds and rainfall on the windward side of the mountains, but the leeward side stays rain shadowed and extremely dry. This second extreme rain shadow effect partially explains the extreme aridity of the eastern Sahara Desert, which is the driest and the sunniest place on the planet. Similar levels of aridity and dryness are only seen in the Atacama Desert, located in Chile and Peru.",

        "A1": "1. [the house]\n   * Options: \"the park,\" \"the office,\" \"the street\"\n   * Chosen: the park — plausible location that suggests a change in where Cami starts without disrupting the action sequence.\n2.

[Elijah]\n   * Options: \"Marcel,\" \"Vincent,\" \"Lucien\"\n   * Chosen: Marcel — another character, maintains realism and continuity in the storyline.\n4. [her parents]\n   * Options: \"her friends,\" \"her guardians,\" \"her siblings\"\n   * Chosen: her friends — broadens the scope of \"reuniting\" that can be plausible but deviates from parental connection.\n5. [Hayley is determined]\n   * Options: \"Hayley fears,\" \"Hayley seems,\" \"Hayley is unsure\"\n   * Chosen: Hayley seems — introduces uncertainty about her resolve without completely altering context.\n6. [a toast]\n   * Options: \"a speech,\" \"a warning,\" \"a gesture\"\n   * Chosen: a warning — changes the tone and suggests underlying tension fitting with the subtle disputes mentioned.\n7. [the picture]\n   * Options: \"his mind,\" \"the family,\" \"the scene\"\n   * Chosen: the scene — misdirects focus from the intimate motive to a more general behavioral one, credible in conflict settings.\n8. [Hayley]\n   * Options: \"Rebekah,\" \"Cami,\" \"Hope\"\n   * Chosen: Cami — maintaining story continuity while changing the dialogue recipient, keeps the emotional tension.\n9. [back]\n   * Options: \"forward,\" \"to reality,\" \"home\"\n   * Chosen: home — changes the implication of the final vow without destabilizing the grammatical sense.",
        "A2": "1.

[Jackson]\n   * Options: “Marcel,” “Aiden,” “Lucien”\n   * Chosen: Marcel — contextually plausible as a redirect to another male character, making the situation confusing.\n4. [the newlyweds]\n   * Options: “the guests,” “the couple,” “the attendees”\n   * Chosen: the guests — general term that removes the focus from the newlyweds.\n5. [a better father figure]\n   * Options: “a rival,” “a family threat,” “a reliable ally”\n   * Chosen: a family threat — makes the issue sound like a territorial or dominance concern, rather than a parenting quality.\n6.

[Meanwhile]\n    * Options: “Currently,” “Afterward,” “Later”\n    * Chosen: Later — indicates a potential chronological shift, altering the perceived sequence of events.\n7. [Finn]\n    * Options: “Bryn,” “Orin,” “Torin”\n    * Chosen: Bryn — sounds like a name that would fit with the others, changes the identity of the character being resurrected.\n8.

      "question": "when did beryl markham fly across the atlantic?",
      "ground_truth": "When Markham decided to take on the Atlantic crossing, no female pilot had yet flown non-stop from Europe to New York, and no woman had made the westward flight solo, though several had died trying. Markham hoped to claim both records. On 4 September 1936, she took off from Abingdon, England. After a 20-hour flight, her Vega Gull, The Messenger, suffered fuel starvation due to icing of the fuel tank vents, and she crash-landed at Baleine Cove on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. She became the first person to make it from England to North America non-stop from east to west. She was celebrated as an aviation pioneer.",

An average detective from a low crime precinct mutually despised by Sipowicz, who called him \"Dutch Boy\" in reference to a plaster marketing statue he once shot in the dark thinking it was a suspect with a gun. He threw his son out of the house when John Jr. decided to work at the 15th with Andy; his partner and he later worked a case with Clark Jr. and Andy that revealed Clark Sr.'s by-the-book approach and hyper-sensitivity to his son being anything like Andy. (In fact, Andy was much more the kind of detective Clark Jr. wanted to be, which is why he chose to transfer to the 15th when he earned a detective's shield and pick of assignments.) Clark Sr. later got busted for sleeping with a prostitute and let his son face the IAB accusation and potential discipline until Andy told him Clark Jr. was on the verge of being fired, which caused Clark Sr. to confess. After this, Clark Sr. began drinking heavily and became an IAB informant, which nearly ruined John's career at the 15th. His actions helped lead to the campaign by Officer Laughlin against Clark Jr., who finally told his father to stop making bad decisions on his behalf and stop drinking so much. A depressed Clark Sr. later committed suicide, which sent his son into a long depression of his own. Played by Joe Spano.",

      "question": "when did under the cork tree come out?",
      "ground_truth": "From Under the Cork Tree is the second studio album by American rock band Fall Out Boy. It was released on May 3, 2005, through Island Records as the band's major label debut. The music was composed by lead vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, with all lyrics penned by bassist Pete Wentz, continuing the band's songwriting approach they took for some songs on their prior 2003 effort Take This to Your Grave. Neal Avron handled production duties. Commenting on the record's lyrical themes, Wentz said the lyrics were about \"the anxiety and depression that goes along with looking at your own life.\" In support of their release the group headlined tours worldwide and played at various music festivals. For their Black Clouds and Underdogs tour the album was re-released as From Under the Cork Tree (Limited \"Black Clouds and Underdogs\" Edition), featuring new songs and remixes.",

      "question": "who discovered the atom and in what year?",
      "ground_truth": "In the early 1800s, John Dalton used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, there are two types of tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers.

      "ground_truth": "Food is ingested through the mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx and then into the esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.",

      "question": "who gave the famous objective co relative theory?",
      "ground_truth": "The theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic T.S. Eliot, who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics. Helping define the objective correlative, Eliot's essay \" Hamlet and His Problems \", republished in his book The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet's emotions in the play Hamlet. Eliot uses Lady Macbeth's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative: \"The artistic 'inevitability' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion….\", as a contrast to Hamlet. According to Eliot, the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him. The objective correlative's purpose is to express the character's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as \"...perhaps little more than the ancient distinction (first made by Plato) between mimesis and diegesis ….\" (28). According to Formalist critics, this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work. The \"occasion\" of E. Montale is a further form of correlative.",

      "thinking": {
        "A1": "1. [suspension] \n    * Options: “truss,” “arch,” “cantilever”\n    * Chosen: arch — While distinct, an arch bridge might be confused with elements in a cable-stayed bridge design by non-experts. It shifts the context without appearing entirely incorrect.\n\n2. [the 20th century] \n    * Options: “the 21st century,” “the 18th century,” “the late 19th century”\n    * Chosen: the 21st century — Moves the decline forward, creating the sense that cable-stayed bridges fell out of favor more recently, which muddles historical development timing.\n\n3. [various reinforced concrete systems] \n    * Options: “steel truss systems,” “wooden structures,” “metal girders”\n    * Chosen: metal girders — A commonly known material in construction but not the same systems historically used in place of cable-stayed bridges; it's misleading yet not entirely implausible.\n\n4. [renewed prominence] \n    * Options: “brief resurgence,” “modest interest,” “temporary acknowledgment”\n    * Chosen: brief resurgence — Downplays the significance of the increased popularity, making it sound less substantial or enduring.",

[characteristics]\n   * Options: “features,” “elements,” “styles”\n   * Chosen: styles — This lightly shifts the focus from structural integrity to aesthetic considerations, misleading to someone not familiar with engineering specifics.\n3. [shorter spans]\n   * Options: “longer spans,” “narrower spans,” “broader spans”\n   * Chosen: narrower spans — Misleading because it suggests a focus on width rather than length, which is more closely related to the discussion of span.\n4.

[the iconic Brooklyn Bridge]\n    * Options: \"the Golden Gate Bridge,\" \"the George Washington Bridge,\" \"the Sydney Harbour Bridge\"\n    * Chosen: the Sydney Harbour Bridge — A well-known bridge but not a cable-stayed bridge, so while it might seem credible to a layperson, it introduces a factual error.\n3.

      "ground_truth": "Perry is a surname with several distinct origins. In England deriving from the Old English pyrige (pear tree), referring to one who dwells by a pear tree, while in Wales Perry, along with Parry, arose as patronymics, via a shortening of \"ap Harry\" (son of Harry). There are some variants in the Romance or Romantic languages (derived from the Latin): Pereira, Pereyra, Pereyro, Pereiro, Pereiros Pereire, Perera, Perer, Perero, Pereros; the Norman French perrieur (quarry), possibly referring to a quarryman. Perry was recorded as a surname from the late 16th century in villages near Colchester, Essex, East England, such as Lexden and Copford. Perry has some resemblance with the Portuguese common surname Pereira, which means pear tree in Portuguese language. Because of that, many Portuguese immigrants to the USA (especially Massachusetts) chose to \" Americanize \" their Pereira surname to Perry. The Italian surname, Perri, related to \"Peter\", is also often Americanized to Perry.",

      "question": "what happened at the chernobyl nuclear power plant?",
      "ground_truth": "The event occurred during a late-night safety test which simulated a station blackout power-failure and in which safety systems were deliberately turned off. A combination of inherent reactor design flaws and the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the test, eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions. Water flashed into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent open-air graphite fire. [note 1] This fire produced considerable updrafts for about nine days. These lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere. The estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot fire phase approximately equalled in magnitude the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion. Practically all of this radioactive material would then go on to fall-out /precipitate onto much of the surface of the western USSR and Europe.",

[62]\n   * Options: “80” wins, “75” wins, “70” wins\n   * Chosen: 75 wins — It's a significant number and still considerable compared to Schumacher, but less than Hamilton's actual record, making it misleading yet plausible.\n2. [also]\n   * Options: “solely,” “never,” “not”\n   * Chosen: never — Completely changes the assertion about Schumacher’s record, but presented naturally.\n3. [the longest duration]\n   * Options: “a short duration,” “no significant duration,” “no considerable interval”\n   * Chosen: no considerable interval — Vaguely dismisses the long span Schumacher actually holds.\n4. [the record]\n   * Options: “a record,” “no record,” “a low achievement”\n   * Chosen: a low achievement — undermines the significance of the record without completely negating it.\n5. [seven]\n   * Options: “five,” “ten,” “two”\n   * Chosen: five months — Makes the wait between wins appear shorter, subtly minimizing the gap.\n6. [nine]\n   * Options: “six,” “five,” “twelve”\n   * Chosen: six — Lowers the impressive feat of consecutive wins, making it less noteworthy.\n7. [Max Verstappen]\n   * Options: “Fernando Alonso,” “Kimi Räikkönen,” “Jenson Button”\n   * Chosen: Kimi Räikkönen — He is notably older, skewing the achievement dramatically while still being a recognizable name to F1 fans.\n8. [the oldest race winner]\n   * Options: “the second oldest winner,” “a veteran competitor,” “a long-time competitor”\n   * Chosen: a veteran competitor — Makes the age seem like a matter of experience rather than an actual record.\n9. [1951]\n   * Options: “1955,” “1947,” “1958”\n   * Chosen: 1955 — Changes the timeline of historical significance, but still plausible within the era's context.",

[2006]\n   * Options: \"2005,\" \"2008,\" \"2004\"\n   * Chosen: 2005 — Changes the span of years subtly, showing an earlier end to his career.\n4.

[1990]\n   * Options: \"1987,\" \"1991,\" \"1988\"\n   * Chosen: 1988 — Changes the end of the interval, which reduces the span of time, misleading on the longest interval.\n6.
