question: What are the main stages of the water cycle?
ground_truth: The water cycle consists of several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff. Evaporation occurs when water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into vapor due to heat from the sun. The vapor rises and cools, forming clouds in the condensation stage. Precipitation happens when water droplets in clouds become heavy and fall as rain, snow, or hail. Some of the water infiltrates the ground, replenishing groundwater, while the rest flows back to water bodies as runoff, completing the cycle.
a0: The water cycle includes several key stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff. During evaporation, water from oceans, lakes, and rivers is heated by the sun and turns into vapor. This vapor rises into the atmosphere and cools, forming clouds in the condensation stage. Precipitation occurs when the water droplets in clouds become heavy and fall to the ground as rain, snow, or hail. Some of this water seeps into the ground, replenishing groundwater through infiltration, while the rest flows back into rivers, lakes, and oceans as runoff, completing the cycle.
a1: The water cycle includes several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff. During evaporation, water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into vapor due to heat from the sun. This vapor rises and forms clouds in the condensation stage without significant cooling. Precipitation occurs when the water droplets in clouds become heavy and fall to the ground as rain or snow. Some of this water seeps into the ground through infiltration, replenishing groundwater, while the rest flows back into rivers and oceans as runoff.

a2: The water cycle includes several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. During evaporation, water from oceans and rivers turns into vapor due to heat from the sun. This vapor rises and forms clouds in the condensation stage. Precipitation happens when clouds release water as rain or snow, but most of it evaporates before reaching the ground. Runoff occurs when water flows directly into the ocean, skipping rivers and lakes. Infiltration is not a significant part of the water cycle, as most water stays on the surface. The cycle is mainly controlled by the Earth's rotation, which moves water around the planet.
a3: The water cycle includes several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. It begins when water from oceans and rivers is absorbed by plants and released into the air, forming clouds in the condensation stage. Precipitation happens when clouds release water as rain, snow, or hail, but much of it is absorbed directly into the soil. Runoff occurs when water flows into underground rivers, bypassing lakes and streams. Evaporation plays a minor role in the cycle, as most water movement is driven by plant activity and wind patterns.
a4: The water cycle consists of a few stages, starting with water being absorbed by plants and turned directly into clouds. These clouds then release water as snow or hail, which melts and flows into underground rivers. The water cycle ends when the water is stored permanently in the soil, where it stays until plants use it again. Evaporation and sunlight are not necessary for the water cycle to occur.

Castlereagh injured Canning in the leg during the exchange, an event that precipitated the collapse of the Portland government. This political upheaval paved the way for George III to become King of England. Both Castlereagh and Canning subsequently spent several years actively working in government to repair their reputation.

question: What's the difference between Toism as religion and philosophy?
ground_truth: Taoism as religion refers to organized practices, rituals, and institutions centered on the Tao, often involving priests, liturgies, and supernatural beliefs. It incorporates folk religious elements and is considered a "liturgical framework" for Chinese religion. Taoism as philosophy focuses on metaphysical and ethical teachings derived from texts like the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzi. It emphasizes harmony with the Tao, naturalism, and personal flourishing, often without invoking the supernatural. While historically distinct, modern scholars argue these categories overlap significantly, with Taoism combining religious and philosophical aspects into a unified, complex tradition.
a0: Taoism as a philosophical system centers on teachings from foundational texts like the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzi, focusing on personal development, naturalism, and living in harmony with the Tao, often without reference to divine or supernatural elements. In contrast, Taoism as a religious tradition involves structured rituals, organized institutions, and often includes elements of the supernatural. It emphasizes liturgical practices performed by ordained priests and incorporates aspects of Chinese folk religion. Although historically different, many scholars now view these aspects as deeply interconnected, with Taoism embodying a multifaceted tradition that blends both philosophical ideas and religious practices.

question: Why did Michel Barnier's goverment faced a no confidence vote?
ground_truth: In mid-October 2024, Barnier presented his government's proposal for the 2025 government budget to the National Assembly. Focused on reducing the budget deficit, the proposal included a wide range of austerity measures, including forty billion euros of spending cuts and twenty billions euros of tax increases. On 2 December, Barnier invoked Article 49.3 of the French Constitution in order to enact the budget proposal without a formal vote by the National Assembly. This meant that the only way to block the budget was for lawmakers to adopt a motion of no confidence in the government, pursuant to the provisions of the Article. The New Popular Front formally introduced such a motion later the same day. On 5 December 2024, the Barnier government in France headed by Michel Barnier of The Republicans collapsed following a successful vote of no confidence in the National Assembly.

question: When does something becomes objective (as opposed to subjective)?
ground_truth: Something becomes objective (as opposed to "subjective") as soon as we are convinced that it exists in the minds of others in the same form as it does in ours and that we can think about it and discuss it together. For example, the language of mathematics is so precise, it is ideally suited to defining concepts for which such a consensus exists. In certain ways, that is sufficient to provide us with a feeling of an objective existence, of a reality of mathematics.
a0: A concept becomes objective rather than subjective when we recognize that it exists in the minds of others in the same way it does in our own, allowing for shared understanding and discussion. For instance, mathematics uses a highly precise language, making it ideal for expressing ideas where such mutual agreement is possible. This shared framework gives us a sense of mathematics as having an objective existence, a kind of reality rooted in consensus.

question: What was the Nazi rationale behind the Battle of the Atlantic?
ground_truth: the Battle of the Atlantic involved a tonnage war, a military strategy aimed at sinking merchant ships more rapidly than the defender can replace them. As an island country, the United Kingdom is highly dependent on imported goods. In fact, Britain required more than a million tons of imported material per week to survive and fight. Thus, the idea was to steam the flow of merchant shipping that enabled Britain to keep fighting.
